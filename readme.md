List the key features of your project, highlighting what makes it useful and unique.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
 - You must have vite globally installed to checkout the frontend part of the project.
   Do it according to below steps given.

### Installation
 Provided are step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project. 

# Installation steps:

- Step 1: Install vite globally as it uses vite for frontend. You can use the following command:
  npm install -g create-vite

- Step 2: After installing Vite globally, you should be able to use the vite command in any directory on your system.
  To do this, navigate to your project directory and run:
  Using npm:
  npm install --save-dev vite
  
- Step 3: After installing Vite locally in your project, you can use it by running the Vite development script defined in your project's package.json.     
  This script is typically named "dev" or "serve." as I have a "dev" script in my package.json, you can start the development server like this:
  Using npm:
  npm run dev

- Step 4: If the "dev" script starts a development server, you can typically access the application in a web browser by going to the specified URL, often  
          http://localhost:port (e.g., http://localhost:3000). The exact URL will depend on project's configuration.
   
- And here you can opt for frontend and backend servers of the project to run on your local server.
